# Routine registry

Every scheduled Claude Code routine attached to this repository, and a journal of what each firing
did. Maintained by the routines themselves, reviewed by a human.

## Active routines

| Routine | Schedule (UTC) | Local | Prompt | Model | Branch | Created |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `daily-loop-research` | `0 13 * * *` | 06:00 PT | [`daily-loop-research.v1.md`](prompts/daily-loop-research.v1.md) | claude-sonnet-5 | `routine/experiments` | 2026-08-02 |

Routine IDs and run history: <https://claude.ai/code/routines>

### `daily-loop-research`

**Purpose.** Control plane for [spec 012](../specs/012-schema-conditioned-policy-synthesis/spec.md).
Advances the build order while it is incomplete; afterwards proposes one loop/graph change per day,
queues it for the compute plane, and reports what came back.

**Authority.** May propose, implement build-order steps, queue experiments, regenerate the delimited
README block, and open PRs. May **not** edit gate thresholds or τ, touch held-out schemas, rewrite
run history, or report a number it did not read from a committed file. Rationale in
[spec.md §9](../specs/012-schema-conditioned-policy-synthesis/spec.md).

**Cost.** Session tokens only. It makes no OpenAI calls and holds no secrets — the compute plane
(GitHub Actions) does both.

## Prompt versions

| Version | Date | Change | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v1 | 2026-08-02 | Initial | — |

Prompts are never edited in place. The version is recorded in every run log; editing a prompt
without bumping it silently invalidates every comparison across that boundary.

## Run journal

Newest first. One row per firing, including no-ops and failures — a journal that records only
successes cannot tell the human whether the routine is worth its tokens.

| Date | Type | What happened | Evidence read | PR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | — | No firings yet. Routine created 2026-08-02; first run 2026-08-03 06:00 PT. | — | — |

### Column meanings

- **Type** — `implement` (advanced a build-order step), `research` (proposed a loop change),
  `no-op` (no new evidence), `failed` (the run errored).
- **Evidence read** — the run ids or files the entry's claims came from. An entry with claims and no
  evidence is a review finding, not a record.

## Review checklist

For the human, when reviewing a routine PR:

- [ ] Every number in the README block traces to a committed `run.json`.
- [ ] No gate threshold, τ, or rubric criterion changed.
- [ ] No file under a `holdout-*` path was read or written.
- [ ] The proposed change is one change, not several.
- [ ] The increment states what would refute it.
- [ ] The registry row matches what the diff actually does.
